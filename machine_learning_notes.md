# Machine Learning   

## STEPS  


1. Import the Data: in a csv file   
2. Clean Data : such as removing duplicate data becasue duplicated data will not fit into the model as it will have a bad pattern of data and produces a wrong results  
3. Split the Data into Training / Test Sets: 80% for training and 20% for testing such as.    
4. Create a Model: selecting an algorithm and analyse data such as decision trees and neural network and so on.   
5. Train the Model   
6. Make Predictions   
7. Evaluate and Improve predictions   


## LIBRARIES 
1. Numphy: provides a multidimentional array  
2. Pandas: Data analysis libraries provide a concept called dataframe. A dataframe is a 2D data structure similar to the spreadsheet, we hav rows and columns, 
3. MatPlotLib: 2D ploting library creating graphs and plots   
4. SciKit-Learn: machine learning libraries provides all the common algorithms like decision trees, neuroal libraries etc.   

## Jupyter Notebook   
**short-cuts**  
1. Press esc for the command mode:  
   Press B: will add a cell below the current cell     
   Press A: will add a cell above the current cell   
   Press D twice for deleting a cell   

2. **Auto Completion: Edit Mode (press Enter to enable)**   
   object.press tab: such as df.press tab  
   Shift-Tab: tooltipCursor on function or attribute and press shift-tab   
   

## Downloading Dataset from Kaggle.com  

## Pandas Dataframe Commands   

df.shape: shows records and columns , 2D array    
df.values: returns 2D array
df.describe(): returns basic info of each column
